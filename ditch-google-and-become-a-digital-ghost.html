Do you like the idea that they know what your favorite shows are, where you like to go on vacation, and what your friends and family look like?</p><p><a name="_GoBack"></a> Even if you close the apps, they’re still running and collecting data on you. It should at least be a given that if the app is closed, it shouldn’t be discovering even more info about youbut massive corporations don’t care about the fact that they’re being sneaky and deceptive. Your privacy is not important to them. The entirety of their billion dollar business model is built around selling your data to the highest bidder so they work against your privacy every chance they get.</p><p>There are a few things you can do to protect yourself and your personal information, such as unlinking certain accounts and switching to a different search engine and email server. But online privacy has many complex details involved in it and often requires a professional security advisor for maximum protection and peace of mind.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the ways your data is being collected and what you can do about it.</p><h2><a name="_8om8r4nrgu5m"></a>You’re always being watched</h2><p>Keep Google maps on your phone? It knows you spent two hours at the movie theater, one hour in Target, walked across the street to Dick’s Sporting Goods, stayed in there for two hours, walked back across the street to your car parked at Target’s, and then drove the 10-minute route home.</p><p>Google Photos know what your friends and family’s faces looks like (and yours, of course). It knows where you’ve gone on day trips, weekend trips, and out-of-state trips. It has pictures of the places you’ve visited along with the people who went with you.</p><p>Do you have Google Home hanging out at your house? It has your voice, voice inflections, preferences, and routines memorized.</p><p>Your favorite news articles are being pushed in front of you because that’s what Google News knows you like. They track what you read and what you don’t and pay attention to your choices so they can, supposedly, give you the best service possible. At least, that’s what they’d have us believe.</p><p>Youtube knows exactly what type of entertainment keeps you glued to your phone for hours. It knows what style of music videos you like to watch, if baby goat videos are your thing, if you like to watch re-runs of old TV shows, or if you’re more of an educational, documentary type of person.</p><p>And for everything that Google doesn’t know, it has plenty of questions and “suggestions” trying to learn more details about you and your personal life and habits.</p><p>Facebook is just as bad, if not worse. When you sign up with an account, they automatically know your name, email or phone number, gender, and birthday.</p><p>Once you start using Facebook, they keep track of every ad you click on (what you look for and like in your personal life), every single friend, what high school you went to, your maiden name, where you’ve worked at before and where you work now, your hometown, and every single click, like, share, and tag that happens on Facebook.</p><p>Even worse, these apps still gather data on you -- even after you closed them.</p><p>Is it just me, or is that a little creepy?</p><h2><a name="_x9ey5cgclnli"></a>Why you should fight back</h2><p>Some people just accept such a massive invasion of their privacy as part of the trade-off. Google has convenient features and apps that sync together. People use those features and apps on a daily basis, and they figure it’s not worth giving up just to keep a huge corporation from learning every detail about them.</p><p>But how comfortable are you with that? How safe do you feel knowing that <i>every single </i>search you’ve made <i>could </i>become public? It’s not a far-fetched thought. Scary things like that have happened before, and nobody knows what the future holds.</p><p>Even if a company like Google or Facebook doesn’t voluntarily share your information with certain members of the public (or the government…) they’re still storing that information. What would happen if an employee went rogue and started leaking profile info out? Or what if they got hacked?</p><p>After all, even big corporations aren’t immune to the most sophisticated hackers. In fact, they’re often the biggest targets. And depending on their security systems, one wrong click made by an uninformed employee could compromise the whole system -- including all of your personal info.</p><h2><a name="_z24oh58isjb4"></a>How to save your privacy</h2><p>There are a few things you can do to escape from the clutches of the massive corporations.</p><p>Replace your Google search engine with DuckDuckGo. DuckDuckGo was specifically created to protect your privacy after the founders saw a rising need and public concern for a search engine that didn’t collect personal data.</p><p>It has pretty much everything the Google search engine has and is a very good alternative when it comes to the results you get from it. And you don’t have to lay awake at night worrying about your personal, private information being watched, analyzed, and manipulated.</p><p>On top of that, replace Gmail with Protonmail. Protonmail, like DuckDuckGo, is also built around protecting your privacy and is a way to further protect your data from large corporations.</p><h2><a name="_vb2xtyiazcv7"></a>Next Steps</h2><p>It can seem tough to get away from all of the personal and private data-collecting companies out there, especially when they seem like they’re a monopoly.</p><p>Even if you do switch your search engine over to DuckDuckGo and your email server to Protonmail, you’ll still be exposed to Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. Google will still know your email address if anybody who has a Gmail account adds you as a contact (or already has you in there as a contact).</p><p>Your friends and family members may have facial recognition turned on in their Google Photos account which works day and night to catologue every photo you’re in. They may also have you tagged in old Facebook pictures.</p><p>It’s so important to protect your data and privacy from companies that use it in questionable ways and who may someday expose it to the public eye. But protecting your privacy is complicated. Often, you need a professional security firm to step in and take care of all of the complex details so your information is as safe and secure as possible.</p><p>With the right steps taken, you’ll be able to wiggle out from underneath the shadow of corporations who have the ability to know and learn way too much about your personal life and preferences.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__footer__col"><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://oppysec.github.io/as-hacking-rises-influencers-turn-to-cybersecurity-experts.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">As Hacking Rises, Influencers Turn To Cybersecurity Experts</a></h5></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-center">OppySec.com</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://oppysec.github.io/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://oppysec.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=16be857f09f55a0c76ea5e92e1f5f9d0"></script></body></html>
