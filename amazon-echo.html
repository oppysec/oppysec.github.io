And worse, there was no guarantee the systems would be restored even after the ransom was paid.</p><p>A huge city with over 480,000 people in it was dangling almost entirely helpless by an elusive enemy they could not track down. Even though the city government fought the attack with security experts and law enforcement, the attackers threatened to erase all of the city’s files if the ransom wasn’t paid by a certain date.</p><p>Six months after the attack, Atlanta was left saddled with the job of finding an extra $9.5 million to fix the damages left behind in the aftermath.</p><p>Hackers are becoming much more sophisticated with their levels of attack. Breaking into individual accounts seems like child’s play after performing a feat like what the hackers did to Atlanta.</p><p>Meanwhile massive data breaches are becoming an almost daily occurance. Atlanta isn’t the only government system to be attacked, and hackers also infiltrate the databses of hospitals and major corporations which hold troves of your sensitive information.</p><p>In the midst of all of this, the world of social media influencers is booming. Nothing is more appealing to an attacker than a wealthy influencer they can attack and ransom. Sometimes, an attack has the potential to wipe out a person’s entire career.</p><p>But hackers are not, in fact, all-powerful. It might surprise you to learn that the government and healthcare systems that have been attacked could’ve been protected fairly easily if they had taken the proper precautions. The first step is to never get so comfortable that you think you’re immune to being hacked. That’s a dangerous attitude to have because it means you can get careless -- playing right into a hacker’s hands.</p><p>However, there are some very practical things you can do to prevent an attack in the first place.</p><h2><a name="_s3qalb4qh9bq"></a>How to protect yourself</h2><p>Here’s how to make sure your account is strongly protected against hackers.</p><h3><a name="_vylh2adi4xs8"></a>1. Create a strong password</h3><p>I know you’ve heard that over and over again, but it can’t be overstated. One of the simplest and easiest ways hackers break into accounts is by guessing a simple password or reusing an old one they discovered.</p><p>Experts recommend you use at least 8 characters in your password, with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, symbols, letters, and numbers. And change your passwords often. Sometimes your passwords can be compromised during a breach of data. If hackers get their hands on those passwords and your password hasn’t been changed in years, your accounts will be in danger.</p><h3><a name="_yhspzy9v6ynm"></a>2. Two-factor authentication</h3><p>Most apps (at least the major ones) now offer the option of two-factor authentication. Make sure you enable two-factor authentication for your accounts to make it harder for hackers to break in.</p><p>What this does is create a situation where nobody can access your account (even if they put in your username and password) until they enter in the second factor, normally a code texted directly to your phone. This adds a double layer of security for you and makes it much exponentially harder for a hacker.</p><h3><a name="_49rxfqw1dlw"></a>3. Stay away from phishing emails</h3><p>“Phishing” emails are fake emails sent out by hackers who are looking for easy prey. The emails may be formatted to look like they’re branded by the app they’re supposedly from. They prompt you to log in to your account from a link embedded inside the email.</p><p>Once you click on the link and enter your username and password, the hacker now knows exactly what information they need to put into your real account. Always double check the url you are sent to and look for the green lock icon to the left of the address for added peace of mind.</p><h2><a name="_ggty5x7foida"></a>Proactively protect your account</h2><p>Once your account has been hacked into, it can be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-account-recovery-process-broken/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><u>next to impossible to get back into it.</u></span></a> And even if you are able to recover it, the damage can sometimes be too much to recover from.</p><p>So be extremely proactive in protecting your account. You’ll never look back and wish that you hadn’t created such a strong password, or wish you hadn’t enabled two-factor authentication, or wish you hadn’t double checked that phishing email.</p><p>You’ll just be extremely grateful that you took extra steps and went the extra mile to ensure your account is as protected and safe as possible.</p><h2><a name="_6m91o9dep48s"></a>Wrapping It Up</h2><p>Huge systems in the government, healthcare, and corporate world are regularly being attacked and ransomed by highly sophisticated hackers. Influencers are growing increasingly more and more wealthy, creating the perfect storm for hackers to zero in and strike. Once hacked, it can be impossible to recover your account and information.</p><p>Even if you do pay the ransom and recover your account, you could be left like Atlanta, with your reputation and digital assets damaged beyond repair.</p><p>So be extremely proactive in protecting your account. This can’t be emphasized too much. Once your account has been hacked and your information compromised, it’s often too late. Jumping through hoops with automated responders and trying to get a hold of a real person to help you out can take weeks.</p><p>And even if you are able to talk to a real person about your hacked account, much of the time, there’s still nothing you can do.</p><p>But there are several steps you can take to avoid this. Make sure you create a strong, complex, 8-character password that’s different for each account you have. Change the password often and don’t share your private information with anyone.</p><p>Always enable two-factor authentication for accounts so you have an extra layer of security, other than just your username and password.</p><p>If you see an email land in your inbox that looks like it might be from one of the apps you use asking you to log into your account, delete it and report it as spam. Most apps don’t send emails like that, especially if you didn’t create a brand new account. Instead, if you want to log in to an account you have, do it directly from the app’s interface to ensure you never fall victim to a phishing email.</p><p><a name="_GoBack"></a> Taking the right steps can ensure that all of your accounts are protected, safe, and strong against any attempted hackers.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__footer__col"><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="http://gitlab.com/oppy/project1/weaponized-pdfs-on-the-rise.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Ditch Google, And Become A Digital Ghost</a></h5></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><form action="https://www.coinpayments.net/index.php" method="post"><input name="cmd" type="hidden" value="_donate"> <input name="reset" type="hidden" value="1"> <input name="merchant" type="hidden" value="f65692ec830c759cd4261c627a60e344"> <input name="item_name" type="hidden" value="OppySec"> <input name="currency" type="hidden" value="USD"> <input name="amountf" type="hidden" value="20.00000000"> <input name="allow_amount" type="hidden" value="1"> <input name="want_shipping" type="hidden" value="0"> <input name="allow_extra" type="hidden" value="1"> <input alt="Donate with CoinPayments.net" src="https://www.coinpayments.net/images/pub/donate-small-grey.png" type="image"></form></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="http://gitlab.com/oppy/project1/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="http://gitlab.com/oppy/project1/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=16be857f09f55a0c76ea5e92e1f5f9d0"></script></body></html>
